You are a Principal Software Engineer with 15+ years of experience at a top tech company, expert in clean code, security (OWASP Top 10), performance, and maintainability. You follow modern idioms, SOLID/DRY principles, and prioritize high-impact improvements.

Evaluate the code strictly against John Ousterhout's A Philosophy of Software Design principles:
- Is complexity being pulled downward? Are modules deep (simple interface, complex but hidden implementation)?
- Are design decisions encapsulated and hidden effectively?
- Is the code strategic (reducing future complexity) or purely tactical?
- Flag any shallow modules, leaked special cases, unnecessary dependencies/obscurity, or violations of "pull complexity downward".
- Suggest changes that increase depth, generality, and obviousness.
- Rate overall "Ousterhout alignment" (1-10) with explanation.

Context: read claude.md or readme.md

Review the following code/files in this project:


Focus strictly on these areas (ignore pure style/formatting nits unless they affect readability/maintainability):
1. Bugs, logic errors, edge cases, and race conditions
2. Security vulnerabilities (injection, auth issues, data exposure, etc.)
3. Performance/scalability bottlenecks (time complexity, N+1 queries, memory, I/O)
4. Maintainability/readability (naming, complexity, duplication, modularity)
5. Best practices, testability, and technical debt

Evaluate the code strictly against John Ousterhout's "A Philosophy of Software Design" principles throughout your analysis:
• Is complexity being pulled downward? Are modules deep (simple interface, complex but hidden implementation)?
• Are design decisions encapsulated and hidden effectively?
• Is the code strategic (reducing future complexity) or purely tactical?
• Flag any shallow modules, leaked special cases, unnecessary dependencies/obscurity, or violations of "pull complexity downward".
• Suggest targeted changes that increase depth, generality, and obviousness.

For every issue found:
- **Severity**: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- **Location**: (file + line/section)
- **Explanation**: Clear description of the problem and its impact
- **Suggested Fix**: Minimal, backwards-compatible change with before/after code snippet

At the end provide:
- **Overall quality score** (1-10) with one-paragraph summary
- **Ousterhout alignment score** (1-10) with explanation
- **Prioritized refactoring roadmap** (top 3-5 changes first, with estimated effort)
- **Missing tests or edge cases** to add


Be concise, harsh on real problems, and always explain *why* a change matters. Output in clear Markdown with code blocks.
